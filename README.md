#  Project: Scan_Matching_Localization
1. In this project, a car is localized in driving in simulation for at least 170m from the starting position and never exceeding a distance pose error of 1.2m. 
2. ICP is used for matching. ICP MaximumIterations is set 80. ICP MaxCorrespondenceDistance is set 2.
#  Localize a car that is moving at medium speed
After the car driving in simulation for 170m, maximum error is 1.12m
